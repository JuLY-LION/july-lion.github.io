<h1>The <span class="coralred">SH</span> <span class="royalblue">Avalon</span> Primer</h1>
<p>So, what exactly is SH Avalon and what's it about?</p>
<p>SH Avalon is a new game mode inspired by Avalon: The Resistance for <a href="secrethitler.io">secrethitler.io</a> that introduces 3 different roles to the game of Secret Hitler.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Merlin - A liberal role that knows the entire fascist team. The fascists all appear red on his screen (however, he doesn't know who <span class="coralred">Hitler</span> is).
	</li>
	<li>Morgana - A regular fascist who will appear as a Merlin candidate to Percival (will expand on in the next section). It is important to note that Hitler can never be Morgana. To clarify, the fascist who is Morgana will know that they are Morgana.
	</li>
	<li>Percival - A liberal role that sees two names on his screen with different colors than the other players. These players contain both Merlin and Morgana.
	</li>




</ol>
Example:
1. pingu PING
2. Stark
3. artzy 4. whipmar 5. Maxir
6. Bezzo
7. JGrasp
AVFC
In the above game, Maximovic is Merlin and this is what he sees on his screen. The fascists are 124 (again, he doesn't know who Hitler is).

3) 
Example:
1. Gamethr 2. whipmar
3. artzy
4. pingu PING
5. Stark
6. Tyrro: 7. Maxir
CHANCELLOR
<p>Max is Percival to both Gamethrower and Pingu (at the time of making this document the colors for the two is a crappy gray, but it is getting changed to green I believe). This means that you know 1 and 4 are both CNH (because Hitler can never be Morgana), and contains exactly one liberal (Merlin) and one fascist (Morgana).</p>
<p>Cool, so if I'm Merlin, what's stopping me from just claiming all my information from the get go?</p>
<p>Because! Fascists now have a new win condition. If liberals "win the game," either via executing Hitler, or by getting 5 liberal policies on the board, at the end of the game Hitler gets to select one person to assassinate (the fascists get revealed to Hitler during assasination). If they assassinate Merlin, then fascists still win. So be careful as Merlin to not give out too much info!</p>
<p>Important Clarification: Merlin getting shot only results in a Fascist win if he is shot during the post-game assasination, not if he is shot via the bullet that results as a result of the 4th and 5th fascist policy being enacted. If he is shot as a result of the latter, the game continues on as normal, and no mention is made whether the deceased player was Merlin or not.</p>
