		<h1>The <span class="royalred">SH</span> <span class="royalblue">Avalon</span> Primer</h1>

		<p>"So what exactly is SH Avalon, and what's it about?"</p>
		
		<p>SH Avalon is a new game mode inspired by <b>Avalon: The Resistance</b> for <a href="secrethitler.io">secrethitler.io</a> that introduces 3 different roles to the game of <b>Secret Hitler</b>.</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li><b><span class="royalblue">Merlin</span></b>
				- A liberal role that knows the entire fascist team. (And by process of elimination, who the liberals are too.) However, he doesn't know who <span class="royalred">Hitler</span> is.<br>
				<img src="example1.png" alt="Pingu as fascist, Stark as fascist, Artzy, Whipmark as fascist, Maximovic as Merlin, Bezzo, JGrasp."><br>
				In this example, Maximovic is <span class="royalblue">Merlin</span> and this is what he sees. The fascists are revealed to him to be players 1, 2, & 4. (Again, he doesn't know <span class="royalred">Hitler</span>'s identity.)
			</li>
			<li><b><span class="royalred">Morgana</span></b>
				- A regular fascist who will appear as a <span class="royalblue">Merlin</span> candidate to <span class="royalblue">Percival</span>. (explained next) The player assigned as <span class="royalred">Morgana</span> can never be <span class="royalred">Hitler</span>. To clarify, the fascist who is <span class="royalred">Morgana</span> will know that they are <span class="royalred">Morgana</span>.
			</li>
			<li><b><span class="royalblue">Percival</span></b>
				- A liberal role that knows who the roles of <span class="royalblue">Merlin</span> and <span class="royalred">Morgana</span> belong to. However, they won't know who is which, only that these 2 players oppose one another.<br>
				<img src="example2.png" alt="Gamethrower as Merlin candidate, Whipmark, Artzy, Pingu as Merlin candidate, Stark, Tyrro, Maximovic."><br>
				In this example, Maximovic is <span class="royalblue">Percival</span> to both Gamethrower and Pingu. This means that you know they are both <abbr title="Confirmed Not Hitler">CNH</abbr>, and contains exactly one liberal (<span class="royalblue">Merlin</span>) and one fascist (<span class="royalred">Morgana</span>).
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>"Cool, so if I'm <span class="royalblue">Merlin</span>, what's stopping me from just claiming all my information from the get go?"</p>
		
		<p>Because! Fascists now have a new win condition. If liberals reach either of their objectives - either via executing <span class="royalred">Hitler</span>, or by getting 5 liberal policies on the board - then <span class="royalred">Hitler</span> is given a chance to steal their win getting to select one person to assassinate. (The fascists get revealed to <span class="royalred">Hitler</span> during assassination.) If they assassinate <span class="royalblue">Merlin</span>, then fascists win instead. So be careful as <span class="royalblue">Merlin</span> to not give out too much info!</p>
		
		<p><b>Important Clarification:</b> <span class="royalblue">Merlin</span> getting shot only results in a Fascist win if he is shot during the post-game assassination, NOT if he is shot via the bullet that came from the 4th and 5th fascist policy being enacted. If he is shot as a result of the latter, the game continues on as normal, and no mention is made whether the deceased player was <span class="royalblue">Merlin</span> or not.</p>
