<h1>The <span class="royalred">SH</span> <span class="royalblue">Avalon</span> Primer</h1>
<p>So, what exactly is SH Avalon and what's it about?</p>
<p>SH Avalon is a new game mode inspired by <b>Avalon: The Resistance</b> for <a href="secrethitler.io">secrethitler.io</a> that introduces 3 different roles to the game of <b>Secret Hitler</b>.</p>
<ol>
	<li><b><span class="royalblue">Merlin</span></b>
		- A liberal role that knows the entire fascist team. (And by process of elimination, who the liberals are too.) However, he doesn't know who Hitler is.<br>
		<img alt="Pingu as fascist, Stark as fascist, Artzy, Whipmark as fascist, Maximovic as Merlin, Bezzo, JGrasp."><br>
		In this example, Maximovic is Merlin and this is what he sees. The fascists are revealed to him to be players 1, 2, & 4. (Again, he doesn't know who Hitler is.)
	</li>
	<li><b><span class="royalred">Morgana</span></b>
		- A regular fascist who will appear as a Merlin candidate to Percival. (explained next) The player assigned as Hitler can never be Morgana. To clarify, the fascist who is Morgana will know that they are Morgana.
	</li>
	<li><b><span class="royalblue">Percival</span></b>
		- A liberal role that sees two names on his screen with different colors than the other players. These players contain both Merlin and Morgana.<br>
		<img alt="Gamethrower as Merlin candidate, Whipmark, Artzy, Pingu as Merlin candidate, Stark, Tyrro, Maximovic."><br>
		In this example, Maximovic is Percival to both Gamethrower and Pingu. This means that you know they are both CNH, and contains exactly one liberal (Merlin) and one fascist (Morgana).
	</li>
</ol>

<p>"Cool, so if I'm Merlin, what's stopping me from just claiming all my information from the get go?"</p>
<p>Because! Fascists now have a new win condition. If liberals reach either of their victory conditions - either via executing Hitler, or by getting 5 liberal policies on the board - then Hitler is a given a chance to steal their win getting to select one person to assassinate. (The fascists get revealed to Hitler during assasination.) If they assassinate Merlin, then fascists win instead. So be careful as Merlin to not give out too much info!</p>
<p><b>Important Clarification:</b> Merlin getting shot only results in a Fascist win if he is shot during the post-game assasination, NOT if he is shot via the bullet that came from the 4th and 5th fascist policy being enacted. If he is shot as a result of the latter, the game continues on as normal, and no mention is made whether the deceased player was Merlin or not.</p>
